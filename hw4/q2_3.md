Question 2
===========
* Growth function of the form pow(N, dVC).
* I got the epsilon bounds `0.6322`, `0.3313`, `0.2237` and 
`0.2152` respectively.
* See the plots [here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/w3bwl6hyz0).

Question 3
============
* For `N = 5`, the arguments to the growth function in the
four bounds are respectively 10, 5, 10, 25 all of which < `dVC = 50`.
* The growth function will then be of the form pow(2, N) instead of
pow(N, dVC).
* I got the answers `4.2546`, `2.8137`, `1.744` and `2.2645`
respectively.
